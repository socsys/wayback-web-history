## Abstract
Since the inception of the first web page three decades back, the Web
has evolved considerably, from static HTML pages in the beginning
to the dynamic web pages of today, from text-only to more towards
multimedia, etc. Although much of this is known anecdotally, to our
knowledge, there is no quantitative documentation of the extent
and timing of these changes. This paper attempts to address this
gap in the literature by looking at the top 100 Alexa websites for
over 25 years from the Internet Archive or the “Wayback Machine”,
*archive.org*. We study the changes in popularity, from Geocities
and Yahoo! in the mid-to-late 1990s to the likes of Google, Facebook,
and Tiktok of today. We also look at different categories of
websites and their popularity over the years, the emergence and
relative prevalence of different mime-types (text vs. image vs. video
vs. javascript and json) and study whether the use of text on the
Internet is declining

The paper PDF will be available soon!
